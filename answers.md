- **b.**
The recurrences for Work and Span of this solution are the work is W(n) = W(n-1) + O(1), and the recurrence for the span is S(n) = max(s(n-1),w(n)). The big O for the work and span is W(n) = O(n) and S(n) = O(n). 



- **d.**
The recurrences for the work and span of this solution are W(n) = 2W(n/2) + O(n) and the big O solution for the work is O(n) and the recurrence relation for span is S(n) = S(n/2) + O(lg n) which has the big O solution of O(lg n). 




- **f.**
The recurrences for the Work and Span of this solution are W(n) = 2W(n/2) + 1 which has a big O solution of O(n) and the Span of this solution is S(n) = S(n/2) + 1 which has a big O solition of O(lg n).
